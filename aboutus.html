            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>The products we have listed for auction or buy it now are accurately described and the photos are as close to "in hand" as we can get them. We will respond to any message as quickly as we can and ship your item either the same business day or the next. We want every purchase you make to be as seamless as possible. Your satisfaction really is my top concern. We have been coin collectors for many years and enjoy all types of US and World silver coins. Our main focus is selling junk silver in lot format, but from time to time we will also sell individual silver coins. Lot items are stock photos and the items pulled randomly from available inventory. We will show you exactly the number of coins available in a typical junk silver lot and a typical condition of the coins as inventory changes. All junk silver lots will consist of 90% US silver coins. Individual coins are photographed for each listing, so you will know exactly what the coin looks like for your collection. 
              
              </p>
              <p>
                A note about the term "Junk Silver":
                This lot consists of "Junk Silver", an industry term used to describe
                silver coins that have little to no numismatic value. The value is in
                the silver content only, where the weight and silver content is known
                by the face value of the coins purchased. The coins weight may vary slightly
                due to normal wear while in circulation. The lot probably contains no key date
                or semi key date coins, but since I do not search the coins, there may be
                a slight chance one may exist in the lot you purchase.
                Junk Silver is strictly a way to invest in 90% silver coinage.
                 </p>
                 <p><b>
    
                Information on the weights of the lots I list.
                </b></p>
                <p>
                All lots are listed as overall coin weight, not silver weight.
                The weights for each coin are listed below, as minted:
                Dimes - 2.5 grams
                Quarters - 6.25 grams
                Halves - 12.5 grams
                 
                Lots consist of the following face value and approximate weights:
                $1 Face value = approximately 25 grams
                1 Troy ounce = $1.25 Face Value, approximately 31.10 grams
                1/4 Troy pound = $3.75 Face Value, approximately 93.31 grams 
                1/2 Troy pound = $7.50 Face Value, approximately 186.62 grams
                 </p>

                Coins with normal wear will cause the overall weight of your lot
                to be a little less than what is listed, so the weight listed is
                the approximate weight of the lot(s) you will receive.</p>
